# PIM

PIM is a light weight terminal based text editor written in Go. It is inspired
by Vim hence the name Pim which ryhmes with Vim and means typing in Thai. It
only contains a subset of Vim features and is not intended to be a full
featured text editor. Its goal is to be a simple and fast text editor that can
be used for quick edits and small files. I started this project to as I felt in
love with vim and would like to learn more about how text editors work. 
A lot of the implementation and design is based on vim and teh Book [The Craft of Text Editing](https://www.finseth.com/craft/)
